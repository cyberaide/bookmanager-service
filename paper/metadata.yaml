  |As the needs of online students rapidly change today, we propose a novel new method for their curriculum needs- 
  |an online Bookmanager service that allows them to customize their learning process. Through a drag and drop Flask model
  |of book chapters that is hosted on a webservice provider, we allow students to organize their learning as best fits their needs.
