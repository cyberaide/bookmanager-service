## Container

A container is available but we have not yet documented how to use it 

## Adding new book tamplates

The book tamplates are in 

`bookmanager-service/books`

you should be able to modify them in your local copy.

## Bugs

1. Selecting a chapter should automatically select the parents. This is not yet implemented.
2. REFERENCES must always bee checked on.
3. The container is not yet using mount or the host network.
4. This has only ben tested on macOS
